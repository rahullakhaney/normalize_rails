[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/normalize_rails.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/normalize_rails)

A ruby gem for [normalize css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets.
Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'normalize_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install normalize_rails

## Usage

To your ```application.css``` file, add:

```CSS
@import "normalize";
```

This is all you need to have all the browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
